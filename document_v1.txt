GUI Calculator - Project Documentation

Project Overview
The GUI Calculator is a desktop application built using Python's Tkinter library. It provides basic arithmetic operations and supports both mouse and keyboard input. The calculator offers a clean, user-friendly interface with a modern color scheme.


Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
- Keyboard input support for digits, operators, and Enter/Escape keys.
- Error handling for invalid expressions.
- Dark-themed user interface.

Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python 3
- Library: Tkinter (Standard GUI Toolkit for Python)

Project Structure
The project consists of a single Python script with the following key components:
- GUI Setup: Creates and configures the application window.
- Functions:
  - button_click(number): Handles button input.
  - button_clear(): Clears the input field.
  - button_equal(): Evaluates the mathematical expression.
  - key_press(event): Manages keyboard input.
- Event Handling: Binds keyboard events for seamless input.

Code Explanation
1. Importing Libraries:
   Imports Tkinter as `tk` for GUI components.

2. GUI Initialization:
   Creates a window with title, background color, and key bindings.

3. Functions Overview:
   - button_click: Appends clicked button value to the input field.
   - button_clear: Clears input.
   - button_equal: Evaluates the expression using eval().
   - key_press: Detects keyboard inputs and triggers corresponding actions.

4. Button Configuration:
   - Dynamic button creation using a loop.
   - Configured with a dark color scheme.

5. Main Loop:
   Starts the Tkinter event loop to keep the application running.

Usage Instructions
1. Run the script using Python 3:
  
   calculator_v1.py
   
2. Use mouse or keyboard for input.
3. Click or press "=" to get the result.
4. Press "C" or Escape to clear input.


 Future Improvements
- Add advanced operations (square root, percentage, etc.).
- Implement memory functions (M+, M-, MR).
- Enhance input validation and security.


 Conclusion
The GUI Calculator project demonstrates the use of Tkinter for creating interactive applications. It is a solid foundation for learning GUI programming in Python and can be expanded further to create more advanced tools.
